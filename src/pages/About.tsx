              <p className="mb-4">
                Hello, I'm Deepali Agrawal, a passionate tarot reader with 2 years of experience in this mystical art. My journey with tarot began when I was seeking answers during a challenging phase of my life. The profound insights I received from my first reading sparked a lifelong fascination with the cards.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Over the past two years, I have dedicated myself to mastering the intricate symbolism and meanings behind each tarot card. I've studied various decks and techniques, combining traditional wisdom with my intuitive abilities to provide accurate and meaningful readings.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                What sets me apart is my holistic approach to tarot reading. I don't just interpret the cards; I provide practical remedies and powerful switch words that help you take actionable steps toward your goals. My readings are designed to empower you with knowledge and tools for positive transformation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that tarot is not about predicting a fixed future, but about understanding the energies around you and making informed choices. My mission is to guide you toward clarity, healing, and personal growth through the ancient wisdom of tarot cards.
              </p>
